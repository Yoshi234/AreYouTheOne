
for the selection frame ...
just have a cursor that can go over each and every option and select them
like a 4 x 4 grid that selects the matches
once an object is selected, it should be crossed out or deleted from the screen view..

Main Game Loop
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ie.) the main game loop will
#      1.    be activated after the start function input is fulfilled
#      2(a). once in the main game loop, it will bring you to a page which lets you choose the attribute values/names of the characters or automatically generate characters (default capability which will be enabled for now
#      2(b). this will lead you to the next screen which will let you pick which characters you believe are matches
#      (for future update: game will go through each of the matches and produce some kind of output about their interaction. ie; they had a fight, or they hooked up right away, or they cheated, or some other indication of how well they get along)
#      (for future update: transitions will occur between different screens)

#      2(c). The game will tell you how many of the matches are actually correct
#      2(d). The game will take you to the truth booth. Pick one of your current matches to send to truth booth. The game will then tell you whether they are a perfect match or not. If they ARE a perfect match, then the game takes those players out of circulation. Ie.) you cannot choose them as a match for the next round of selection
#      2(e). The game loop restarts

Game loop dev process:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. set all of your initial input values and overall display/window dimensions
2. Create a method to check the events which occur while the game is running


# cannot figure out how to implement the inputs correctly, so for now it will be just a series of default names for the characters

if you send a perfect match to the truth booth, and they are a perfect match, then it will remove that perfect match from the pool. So it will only output the names of characters who are still in the pool

pseudo code 

for matches in perfect_matches:
    for person in matches:
        draw_text(person, 30, )
